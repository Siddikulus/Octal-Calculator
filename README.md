# Octal-Calculator
Octal Calculator using Lex and YACC
PROJECT REPORT
 


INTRODUCTION
The Octal Numerical System, or Oct for short, is the base-8 number system, and uses the digits 0 to 7.
 Octal numerals can be made from binary numerals by grouping consecutive binary digits into groups of three (starting from the right).
 For example, the binary representation for decimal 74 is 1001010.
 Two zeroes can be added at the left: (00)1 001 010, corresponding the octal digits 1 1 2, yielding the octal representation 112.

OBJECTIVE
The objective of our project is to build an Octal Calculator using Lex (Lexical Analyzer) and YACC (Parser) that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power of a number and to find out the basic trigonometric angles like sin, cos and tan.
The input given to the system is in Octal format and after performing the arithmetic operations on the number, the result shown as the output is in the decimal format. 

WORKING
The Lex program basically generates the tokens and the YACC program uses these tokens to build a parse tree. 

LIMITATIONS
The calculator cannot be used for float or double data types when given as an input.
